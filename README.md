#Loan Eligibity Prediction

This is my sample project, which is a loan eligibility prediction model. It uses a supervised learning algorithm called LogisticRegression, which is part of the Scikit-Learn Python library. 
The model will predict whether a person would be approved for diverse types of loans and credit using 0 for not approved and 1 for approved.
